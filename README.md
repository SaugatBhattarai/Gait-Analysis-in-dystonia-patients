#gait analysis on dystonia patients

# Summary
Dystonia is a disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions which causes slow repetitive movements, abnormal postures, painful movements, tremor or other neurologic features. There are several different forms of dystonia affecting from only one muscle to groups of muscles throughout the body. The cause of Dystonia is still unknown. More importantly, diagnosis of focal dystonia is based on clinical grounds and is therefore open to bias. Hence, the primary goal of this study would be to explore the possibility of using computer vision techniques to obtain some measures which could be used for unbiased classification or diagnosis or different forms of Dystonia. This could then be used as a stepping stone for developing various computer based diagnosis and treatment methods. Moreover, during the study, we would acquire further understanding regarding the pathophysiology of the disease.
We will explore gait analysis, automatic pose and trajectory estimation using deep learning based computer vision techniques.
